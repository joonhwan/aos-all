Art Of Sequence - Super Repository
==================================

This is the super repository gathering all Art Of Sequence 
projects together (using sub-repositories).

This repository is for convenience for developers wanting
to work on several AOS projects at once (as they are related).
Therefore, it will be changed only on important changes of the
referred projects. 
You wil have to fetch changes from their origin repository yourself  
to get the lastest changes. See git documentation for details.

Project dependencies are solved using CMake where necessary.
